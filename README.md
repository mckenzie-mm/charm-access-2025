# Charm Accessories 2025

2025 replacement website using modern technology for the Charm Accessories website built in 2020. The code is identical to the "wwurm winery" website that was built for the company 'Nordicmade' based in Norway (https://www.nordicmade.com/). The code for the "wwurm winery" is at: https://github.com/mckenzie-mm/nordic-frontend

Charm Accessories uses different photos/text from a template file selected from a configuration file when the app is built. The wwurm winery website has a different template file with German text/photos that apply to the winery shop.
