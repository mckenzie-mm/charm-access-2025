# Charm Accessories 2025

A 2025 replacement website using modern technology for the Charm Accessories website built in 2020. The code is identical to the "wwurm winery" demonstration website that I built for Nordicmade.  Charm Accessories uses different photos/text from a template file that is selected from a configuration file when the app is built. The "wwurm winery" website has a different template file with German text/photos that apply to the winery shop. 

The shared code for both is at: https://github.com/mckenzie-mm/nordic-frontend. The website for Charm Accessories can be viewed at: http://3.25.102.86/

The kangaroo logo is by Konstantin: https://www.instagram.com/kostya_reshetnikov/. The model photos are by Alena: https://www.dreamstime.com/alenkasm_info. 

The jewelery images/products were taken from temu: https://www.temu.com/. Charm Accessories sells the same, bracelets, necklaces etc at a lower price and offers fast, local postage and delivery.

Screenshots from the demonstration website are shown below.
