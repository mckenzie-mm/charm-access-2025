# Charm Accessories 2025

Replacement with modern technology of the Charm Accessories website built in 2020. 

It is the same code that was built for the company 'Nordicmade' based in Norway (https://www.nordicmade.com/) but using different photos/text. The photos/text are from a template file selected from a configuration file when the app is built. The wwurm winery website has a different template file with German text/photos.
